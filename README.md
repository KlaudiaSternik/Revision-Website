# Revision Website

As part of my Software Development Bootcamp, I am creating a website that addresses a problem of my choice. I decided to make a revision website that allows the user to enter their own revision content. 

I worked to create pages that update dynamically based on user input, adding or removing text boxes as needed. The website utilises local storage for managing the usersâ€™ revision content.
